I'm an engineering executive and like to build products/companies with world class teams solving practical problems. I build/advise/invest in companies via [ylab](http://ylab.co) and am exploring new ideas via [SPC](https://www.southparkcommons.com/). I like working at the intersection of technology, academia, and government.

I was an early engineering leader at [Samasource](https://sama.com) (recruited by Charlie Cheever) and built the first version of the Samahub platform. I helped the company grow from 5-200 across 3 continents and helped open the Kenya office. I was active in the early Nairobi tech eco-system and helped launch the local [Ruby](https://github.com/nairuby) group. I advise companies/orgs in east africa and am part of the CTO network (please reach out if I can help).

I then worked in politics and government, first at [FWD.us](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/11/mark-zuckerberg-launches-immigration-group), where I led the engineering team working on immigration reform. We launched several advocacy/political tools to varying degrees of success, and I got to meet/learn from some of the best operators across both parties. I serve on the faculty of UC Berkeley teaching two courses on [civic technology](https://haas.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/Syllabus-UGBA39E-Civic-Technology.pdf). I was an early core team member at [USDR](https://www.usdigitalresponse.org/), partnering with [Robin Carnahan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Carnahan) to support counties/local governments in the early days of Covid and helped build their [election worker](https://www.usdigitalresponse.org/case-studies/automating-harris-countys-student-election-clerk-program) management tool.

More recently, I've been working in value based healthcare, first as the head of engineering at [Antara Health](https://www.notboring.co/p/antara-health-natively-integrated). Then as an engineering director at [Cityblock Health](https://www.cityblock.com/). I helped launch [projectN95](https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-trumps-washington/the-coronavirus-and-how-the-united-states-ended-up-with-nurses-wearing-garbage-bags).

I started my career in New York, where I was an early engineer at [Sparknotes](http://sparknotes.com) and [Cake and Arrow](https://cakeandarrow.com/). I studied computer engineering/computer vision at McGill University.

Based between Amsterdam and San Francisco.
