I'm an engineer, leader, and investor. I typically work at the intersection of technology and complicated domains (healthcare, politics, economic development).

Currently I'm investing/advising companies via [ylab](http://ylab.co). If you're working on Ai, Healthcare, or Future of Work, please get in touch. I operate between Amsterdam and San Francisco.

I've been working in healthcare for the past 4 years, first in Nairobi as the head of engineering at [Antara Health](https://www.notboring.co/p/antara-health-natively-integrated). Then as the engineering lead for [projectN95](https://www.projectn95.org/), and as an early core team member at [USDR](https://www.usdigitalresponse.org/). I was also an an engineering director at [Cityblock Health](https://www.cityblock.com/). 

Previously I worked in politics at [FWD.us](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/11/mark-zuckerberg-launches-immigration-group), where I led the engineering team and worked on immigration reform. I serve on the faculty of UC Berkeley teaching a [course](https://haas.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/Syllabus-UGBA39E-Civic-Technology.pdf) at the intersection of politics and technology. 

My first company in SF was [Samasource](https://sama.com) where I was an early engineering leader and worked closely with [Leila](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ce9EfF2lHE). I spent time in Nairobi, wrote some early checks in companies and learned a lot about labor economics, development economics, crowdsourcing and RLHF. 

I started my internet career in New York, where I was an early engineer at [Sparknotes](http://sparknotes.com) and an early employee at [Cake and Arrow](https://cakeandarrow.com/). My first job was in robotics and computer vision in Copenhagen. I studied Computer Engineering at McGill.

I've lived and worked in Amsterdam, Berlin, San Francisco, New York, Rio de Janeiro, Nairobi, and Copenhagen. 

I spend a lot of time thinking about how technology can be useful and love learning.
