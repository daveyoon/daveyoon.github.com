Hello. 

I'm currently a partner at Idealistech Labs, a consultancy based in San Francisco. 

Previously, I served as the Director of Engineering at [Samasource](http://www.samasource.org) where I built the SamaHub and the engineering team. I learned a lot about crowdsourcing and a bit about impact sourcing, labor economics, and development economics.

Prior to that, I was a technical lead at [Alexander Interactive](http://www.alexanderinteractive.com), where I lead cross-functional teams building quality projects. I learned a lot about e-commerce, scaling web applications, best development practices, and how to run projects efficiently. 

I've lived and worked in New York, San Francisco, Rio de Janeiro, Nairobi, and Copenhagen. 

I spend a lot of time thinking about how technology can be used to solve problems in education, healthcare, and economic development. When I get the chance, I spend time climbing, traveling, and listening/making music.
