Hello. 

I'm the director of engineering at [FWD.us](http://fwd.us) and the managing partner at [ylab](http://ylab.co).

Previously, I served as the Director of Engineering at [Samasource](http://www.samasource.org) where I built the SamaHub and the engineering team. I learned a lot about crowdsourcing and a bit about impact sourcing, labor economics, and development economics.

Prior to that, I was a technical lead at [Alexander Interactive](http://www.alexanderinteractive.com), where I lead cross-functional teams building quality projects. I learned a lot about e-commerce, scaling web applications, best development practices, and how to run projects efficiently. 

I have advised projects at the World Bank and Columbia University. My work has been featured in an HBS case study and IEEE. I have presented at Google, Berkeley, IBM Almaden Research Center, the World Bank, and the Monterrey Institute for International Studies.

I've lived and worked in New York, San Francisco, Rio de Janeiro, Nairobi, and Copenhagen. 

I spend a lot of time thinking about how technology can be used to solve problems in education, healthcare, and economic development. When I get the chance, I spend time climbing, traveling, and listening/making music.
