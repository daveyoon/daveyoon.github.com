I'm an engineering executive and like to build products/companies with world class teams solving meaningful problems. I advise/invest in companies via [ylab](mailto:hello@ylab.co) and am exploring a new idea via [SPC](https://www.southparkcommons.com/). I like working at the intersection of technology, academia, and government.

I was the CTO at [Samasource](https://sama.com) (recruited by Charlie Cheever) and built one of the early data labeling companies. We worked with the world bank, a lot of the fortune 500 companies, and helped with the datasets for Uber, Google, OpenAI. I helped open the office in Nairobi and became active in the tech eco-system there. I helped launch the local [Ruby](https://github.com/nairuby) group and enjoy helping companies in that region. 

A friend recruited me to work in politics for Mark Zuckerberg at [FWD.us](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/11/mark-zuckerberg-launches-immigration-group). We launched several advocacy/political tools to varying degrees of success, and I got to meet/learn from some of the best operators across both parties. I served on the faculty of UC Berkeley Haas where I lectured two courses on the intersection of [technology and civics](https://haas.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/Syllabus-UGBA39E-Civic-Technology.pdf). In 2020, I was an early core team member at [USDR](https://www.usdigitalresponse.org/), partnering with [Robin Carnahan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Carnahan) to support counties/local governments in the early days of Covid and helped build their [election worker](https://www.usdigitalresponse.org/case-studies/automating-harris-countys-student-election-clerk-program) management tool. I also helped launch [projectN95](https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-trumps-washington/the-coronavirus-and-how-the-united-states-ended-up-with-nurses-wearing-garbage-bags).

Recently, I've been mostly interested in healthcare, first as the head of engineering at [Antara Health](https://www.notboring.co/p/antara-health-natively-integrated). Then as an engineering director at [Cityblock Health](https://www.cityblock.com/). 

I started my career in New York, where I was an early engineer at [Sparknotes](http://sparknotes.com) and [Cake and Arrow](https://cakeandarrow.com/). I studied computer engineering/computer vision at McGill University.

Based between Amsterdam and San Francisco.
